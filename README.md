# Analyzing_Loyal_customer-
Project Title: Customer Subscription Prediction Using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees
1. Introduction:
•	Description: This project aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a service based on various demographic and behavioral features.
•	Language and Libraries: Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn.

2. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
•	Data Source: Dataset obtained from [source].
•	Features: Features include age, gender, income, past subscription history, etc.
•	Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis.
•	Visualization: Histograms, box plots, scatter plots to understand data distribution and relationships.
•	Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
 
5. Modeling:
•	Logistic Regression:
•	Method: Binary classification model to predict subscription likelihood.
•	Libraries: scikit-learn.
•	Model Training: Fitting the logistic regression model to the training data.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Default hyperparameters used.
•	Decision Trees:
•	Method: Classification algorithm to capture non-linear relationships.
•	Libraries: scikit-learn.
•	Model Training: Training a decision tree classifier with a max depth of 4.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Limited to adjusting max depth for simplicity.

6. Results and Evaluation:
•	Evaluation Metric: Accuracy score on validation set.
•	Interpretation: Comparison of accuracy scores between logistic regression and decision trees.
•	Libraries Used: scikit-learn.

7. Prediction on Test Dataset:
•	Preprocessing: Similar preprocessing steps applied to the test dataset.
•	Prediction: Using the trained decision tree model to predict subscription status.
•	Libraries Used: Pandas, scikit-learn.
8. Submission File Creation:
•	Creating Submission File: Storing test predictions in a CSV file.
•	Conversion: Converting predicted values (1/0) to 'yes'/'no' for better interpretation.
•	Libraries Used: Pandas.
9. Final Steps:
•	Instructions: Detailed steps for using the submission file to generate accuracy score.
•	Additional Notes: Suggestions for model improvement and potential pitfalls.
•	Language Used: Clear and concise instructions in English.
10. Conclusion:
•	Summary: Recap of project objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.
•	Future Work: Suggestions for further analysis or enhancements.
•	Language Used: Reflective and forward-looking language.
